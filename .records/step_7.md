# Chrome Extension Shortcut Assignment Issue

The issue you're experiencing is due to a **shortcut conflict** in your Chrome extension's manifest.json file. Let me explain what's happening:

## The Problem

In your manifest.json file, you have the same keyboard shortcut (Cmd+I on Mac, Ctrl+I on Windows) assigned to two different commands:

1. `copy-markdown-url` - Your custom command to copy the URL in markdown format
2. `_execute_action` - A special Chrome command that activates the extension (opens the popup)

```json
"commands": {
  "copy-markdown-url": {
    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+I",
      "mac": "Command+I"
    },
    "description": "Copy current page URL in markdown format"
  },
  "_execute_action": {
    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+I",
      "mac": "Command+I"
    }
  }
}
```

## Why This Happens

When there's a conflict between shortcuts in Chrome extensions:

1. Chrome prioritizes certain built-in commands over custom commands
2. The `_execute_action` command (which opens the popup) has higher priority than custom commands
3. As a result, pressing Cmd+I is triggering the popup to open instead of executing your URL copying functionality

## Solutions

You have several options to fix this:

### Option 1: Remove the `_execute_action` shortcut
Remove the `_execute_action` command from your manifest.json file, keeping only your custom command:

```json
"commands": {
  "copy-markdown-url": {
    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+I",
      "mac": "Command+I"
    },
    "description": "Copy current page URL in markdown format"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Use different shortcuts
Assign different keyboard shortcuts to each command:

```json
"commands": {
  "copy-markdown-url": {
    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+I",
      "mac": "Command+I"
    },
    "description": "Copy current page URL in markdown format"
  },
  "_execute_action": {
    "suggested_key": {
      "default": "Ctrl+Shift+I",
      "mac": "Command+Shift+I"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Handle both commands in your code
Keep both commands but modify your background.js to handle both:

```javascript
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener((command) => {
  if (command === "copy-markdown-url" || command === "_execute_action") {
    // Your URL copying code here
  }
});
```

This approach is already implemented in your current background.js file, but it won't work properly as long as both commands use the same shortcut, since Chrome will only trigger the higher-priority command.

## Recommendation

The simplest solution is Option 1: remove the `_execute_action` shortcut entirely since you're primarily using keyboard shortcuts for functionality rather than opening the popup.
